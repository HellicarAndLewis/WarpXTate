WarpXTate
=========

We developed an installation for the [Warp x Tate](http://www.warp-x-tate.net) event at Tate Britain as a tribute to the 808 and 303 in collaboration with [John Nussey](http://johnnussey.com/) and [Arthur Carabott](http://www.arthurcarabott.com). 

The event was an evening of performance and installations from [Warp Records](http://www.warp.net) and artist [Jeremy Deller](http://www.jeremydeller.org/), inspired by Deller’s work ‘The History of the World’.
