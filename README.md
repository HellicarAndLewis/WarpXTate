=========

We developed an installation for the Warp x Tate event at Tate Britain as a tribute to the 808 and 303 in collaboration with John Nussey and Arthur Carabot. The event was an evening of performance and installations from Warp Records and artist Jeremy Deller, inspired by Deller’s work ‘The History of the World’.
